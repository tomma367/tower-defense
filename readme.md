#Tower Defense Java Game
This is a personal project I have taken on in order to introduce myself to working with OpenGL, and to to solidify fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming. It is being made through the instruction of [this Youtube tutorial series](https://youtu.be/rfR09erJu7U?list=PLFUqwj4q1Zr8GHs6bO4d6gxMGUh_2pcNg) by [Indie Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0MHs87ehhLOtPQf_bAWDEA).
